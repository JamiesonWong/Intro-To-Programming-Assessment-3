We want out player to move around in a 2d grid map

how dowe decide wether they can move in a vertain direction?

what happen if the plaer tries to move East,West,North,South.
- In order to do this, first we need to know where the player currently is in 5*5 grid map

the map size is 5*5. [0][0]. 
x x x x x  [4][4] - ending point
x x x x x
x x x x x  [2][2] - starting point
x x x x x
x x x x x

so we need to determine if a move valid.
what are the constraints to determining a valid move?
-player can't go to the locations out of 5*5 grid.
